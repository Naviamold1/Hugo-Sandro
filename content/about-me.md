I have always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity, this led me to develop an interest in robotics and coding. Ever since I was young, I have always been interested in taking things apart and putting them back together, and I have always loved to tinker with new technology.
As I grew older, I became more interested in programming and the idea of using code to control and manipulate the physical world. I explore the world of robotics combining my passion for technology and my love of problem-solving. I pursued my interest in robotics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in 2018. In 2019 I went to STEM Camp at Imperial College London and received the highest Platinum Diploma. I take online courses and participate in Olympiads and coding competitions. In 2021 I won Gold Medal in the Lego Robotics Hackathon competition in Georgia. Last month I participated in the Competition for the Georgian Schools in Robotics, financed by the US Embassy.
Currently, I am preparing for international robotics competitions in Turkey and USA where I will be building drones. For my IB MYP Personal Project, I created a Military Website covering technology during WWI, WWII, and the modern era.
I am also a self-learner: I create chatbots and games. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think outside the box.
